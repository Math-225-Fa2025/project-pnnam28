## Purpose  
The purpose of this project is to analyze the Sleep Health and Lifestyle dataset to understand what lifestyle and health factors best predict sleep quality among adults. The project demonstrates skills in data cleaning, visualization, linear regression modeling, and basic exploratory analysis in R.

## Overview  
The dataset includes 374 participants with information on sleep habits, stress, physical activity, daily steps, heart rate, blood pressure, BMI category, and presence of sleep disorders.

The main research question is:

**What lifestyle and health factors best predict sleep quality?**

Supporting sub-questions include:  
- How does stress level relate to sleep quality?  
- Is physical activity associated with better sleep?  
- Do sleep disorders predict lower sleep quality?  
- Are health indicators (heart rate, blood pressure, BMI) associated with sleep quality?

### Methods Summary  
- Cleaned data (parsed blood pressure, created factors)  
- Performed summary statistics and visualizations  
- Built a multiple linear regression model with sleep quality as the outcome  
- Created a helper function to summarize sleep quality by groups  
- Visualized key relationships with jitter and scatter plots  

## Files Included  
- `/data`: dataset and codebook  
- `proposal/`: project proposal  
- `presentation.Rmd`: slide deck source  
- `README.Rmd`: this summary  
- Analysis code embedded in main `.Rmd`
